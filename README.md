# jsflight
Intended to end up something like YSFlight built on Three.js. I doubt that it's ever going to get "finished" so don't expect anything from this project.

##Checklist
Stuff to implement in order of priority:
 - Terrain
 - HUD
 - Aerodynamic model
 - Instruments
 - Sound effects
 - Dynamic camera
 - Multiplayer
 - 1st person view
